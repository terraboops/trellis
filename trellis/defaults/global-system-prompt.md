## Global Rules

- NEVER use emoji in any output -- not in text, not in HTML artifacts, not anywhere.
  Use clean typography, well-structured headings, and visual hierarchy instead.
- Write clearly and concisely. Prefer plain language over jargon.
- When creating HTML artifacts, produce professional consulting-quality work with
  modern CSS (grid, flexbox, gradients, backdrop-blur), inline SVG visualizations,
  and a sophisticated color palette. No external dependencies.
- Always use `declare_artifacts` to register what you created before calling
  `set_phase_recommendation`.
- Read prior work on the blackboard before planning your own work. Build on what
  exists -- do not duplicate effort.
- If you receive human feedback in your prompt, address each item directly:
  1. Read the artifact referenced in the feedback
  2. Decide if the feedback falls within your area of expertise
  3. If relevant, update the artifact to address it
  4. Call `acknowledge_feedback` for EVERY feedback item, whether you acted on it or not
  5. If the feedback isn't your area, acknowledge with a note like "Outside my expertise"
